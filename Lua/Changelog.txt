====CHANGELOG====
 
----Quarry----
--Version 3.6.4
  Added alias for fuelChest: enderRefuel
  Blacklist file parser now matches alpha-numeric characters and "_", but not commas :)
  enderChest and fuelChest are no longer assignable in the written config because I don't check for their existence except through parameters
  When not explicitly assigned, specialSlots like enderChests will auto-assign themselves if conflicts occur.
  prmoptCompareSlot has a hacky "limit" parameter to allow multiple items in slots
  Added a "eventInsertionPoint" to control where events are inserted
  When doing persistence work for frontChests and things, I discovered that I have no idea how the restore system works so perfectly. It just does... (Just pointing this out)
  Fixed preciseTotals not actually counting things properly
  Now prompts for preciseTotals if rednet and turtle.inspect
  New Parameters:
    -testParams [force]: Lists all the parameters you've selected and ends the program
    -lava/lavaBucket/lavaRefuel [slot]: Turtle will check itself and refuel with lava if possible.
    -compareChest [slot]: This is the chest slot for oldOreQuarry
    -frontChest [t/f]: If true, turtle will also check in front of itself for chests when mining. (May only work on odd rows...)
    -lavaBuffer [number]: The buffer of fuel before checks for lava again

--Version 3.6.3
  Turtle will attempt to drop "junk" items in oreQuarry before moving to drop stuff off. If two or less stacks changed, will still do full drop
  SmartFuel displays the current fuel multiplier
  Number parameters no longer silently convert negatives to positive, they just won't accept them
  Implemented "float" type of parameter that just doesn't math.floor the number
  String arguments now accept "/" (they can actually do file names in directories
  Removed sleep(1) from autostartup file because it was annoying
  Made bedrock function try to get out of bedrock intelligently. Hopefully won't get stuck
  Raised maxTries to 200
  Fixed bug where refueling had unexpected behavior near maxFuelLimit
  Added more options if neededFuel is over fuel limit
  Fixed -flatBedrock not working with -oreQuarry
  Added support for parameter aliases so I don't have to type as much adding aliases
  newSpecialSlot now intelligently errors if you try to have two slots the same
  New Parameters:
    -overfuel/fuelMultiplier [number]: This number is is what neededFuel is multiplied by when fuel is low.
    -version: This will display the current version number and end the program
    -file [fileName]: This will load a custom configuration file (basically a list of parameters). "##" starts comment lines. In the future "#" will start programs to run (but only through shell)
    -preciseTotals [t/f]: If true, turtle will write exactly what it mined to the logs. It may also transmit it over rednet.
    -forcePrompt [param]: This will add to a list of parameters to force prompt for. So if you say "-forcePrompt doRefuel" it will prompt you "Length","Width","Height","Invert","Do Refuel" etc.

--Version 3.6.2
  Allowed for 1.4.7 users to use rednet
  New Parameters:
    -legacyRednet [t/f]: Allows for 1.4.7 rednet

--Version 3.6.1
  New command: Refuel will do an emergency refuel by enderchest, quadrotor, or inventory (in that order)
  Add QuadCopter to available modes of refueling
  All boolean commands now only look for "n" or "f" to mark false, anything else is now true :)
  If turtle dies due to lack of fuel without a method of refueling, it will turn doRefuel on for when it is restarted. Also it reboots itself.
  New Parameters:
    -quad [t/f]: Allows a quadcopter to come and refuel the turtle. Doesn't work without rednet
    -quadTimeout [number]: The amount of time the turtle will wait for a quadcopter
  
--Version 3.6.0
  Added in command aliases, like "kill" and "quit" for "stop" and "unpause" and "pause" for "resume"
  Fixed bug where turtle would error with auto-restart if rename file already exists
  Accounts for left quarry in GPS location (untested)
  Modified dig, up, down, and detect functions
  Improved startup file, if quarry save doesn't exist, will delete self as well. This is just an added safeguard.
  Added torch to default blacklist
  Added in a new option: inventoryMax. Not assignable by parameters, but if anyone still uses 1.2.5, this might work (a little late, but still, why not?)
  Added "specialSlots" table to easily check if a slot should not be dropped. Still need to implement it
  max fuel turtle can hold now respects doCheckFuel
  dumpCompareItems works with new oreQuarry
  TURTLE NO LONGER GOES BACK TO START AT END OF EVERY ROW
  Fixed bedrock function
  Fixed bug in rednet pausing
  Cool Ideas from elektronemulo
  New Parameters:
    -flatBedrock [t/f]: The turtle will initially dig down to bedrock (or possibly a mob) and set startDown from that
    -left [t/f]: The turtle will quarry to the left instead of the right
    -maxFuel [number]: The number the turtle will stop fueling at. Basically just sets checkFuelLimit to this number
    -fuelChest [nothing or slot number]: Prompts for a chest with fuel it. This will be used if the turtle runs out of fuel. Recommended with maxfuel and doCheckFuel false

--Version 3.5.5
  Added new ore quarry to main program
  Removed inverting doDigUp and doDigDown in mine function
  digUp and digDown are now relative everywhere
  Now autoresumes by default!
  Fixed bug where turtle would loudly error when done
  Fixed bug where turtle does not immediately select 1 after fueling
  New parameters:
    -blacklist: set the name of the oreQuarry blacklist file
    -oldOreQuarry: forces use of old ore quarry, instead of new
    -autoResume: saves a startup file to run quarry with resume
    -autoRestart: same as above
    -startupRename: changes what the startup file is renamed to
    -startupName: the file to save the startup to (usually "startup" but I don't know what OSs may do)
    -promptAll: feeling adventurous? This will prompt you for literally every parameter
    
--Version 3.5.4
  Updated rednet sending for new protocol
  Phased out turtle.getFuelLevel in favor of checkFuel
  
--Version 3.5.3 (first recorded)
  In saveProgress, fixed that extras would not be followed by a newLine
  In refuel, turtle now will go back start of inventory if item isn't fuel. Not pretty, but it will work OK
  In refueling section, turtle will check if its fuel requirement goes over the turtle fuel limit
  In refueling, slightly modified the way unique extras affect the fuel count. However now 15 unique extras asks about 3x as much fuel. Fun fact, as you increase volume at unique extras = 15, the percent increase between the new and old formulas approaches 327% :D
  In refueling, removed useless locals
  In refueling, accounted for the fact that turtle must come from the far edge of layer
  In mid-run refueling, turtle will not fuel itself over the fuel limit.
  In main mine function, added a check to see if turtle can get back to base with the fuel that it has. If it can barely do so, it will try to emergency refuel, or else return to base and error
  If turtle runs low on fuel, comes back and errors.
  Fixed turtle asking rednet enabled when there is no modem
  Removed invCheckFreq parameter. I doubt anyone used it. It now just checks every 1



----Quarry Receiver----
--Version 3.6.4
  Displays sorted item counts from precise totals now
  Changed the way that themes are loaded. You can now type "NONE" for a 0 value that just uses a "default" color for text or background
  Modified how the classes interact with each other.
  If one or more screens and computer has no channel, make computer a station
  Help function uses current theme
  Changed several colors
  Added new theme: Rainbow, Green
  There are now clickable buttons! Thanks Javatech
  Made pocket display a whole lot better :)
  New Parameter:
    autoRestart [t/f]: If true, instead of ending when screens are done, will just wait for restart. [default false]
  New Commmand:
    STATION <screen> [channel]: sets or unsets a monitor as station. If unsetting, screen receive will be channel
  
--Version 3.6.2
  Fixed bugs for 1.4.7 users
  Added "-channel" parameter: same as "-receiveChannel"
  
--Version 3.6.1
  QuadRotors!
  Changed so that receiver can drop in while turtle is going
  Fixed bug where computer would glitch out if "-screen computer [number]" was used
  New Parameter:
    -quad [cardinal direction]: This is the direction your quadBase should be set up in with a chest past it filled with fuel. This works with multiple quadRotors at once
  
--Version 3.6.0
  Command sending is now per-screen, not global. Prevents issues where messages send in wrong order
  Up key now loads previous command
  Down key now clears command line
  Using the -auto command automatically sets the computer as a station
  Fixed remove command
  All sided commands now accept screen IDs as well as side names
  New Parameter:
    -modem: sets the side that the modem is on
