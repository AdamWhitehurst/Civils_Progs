====CHANGELOG====

----Quarry----
--Version 3.5.3 (first recorded)
  In saveProgress, fixed that extras would not be followed by a newLine
  In refuel, turtle now will go back start of inventory if item isn't fuel. Not pretty, but it will work OK
  In refueling section, turtle will check if its fuel requirement goes over the turtle fuel limit
  In refueling, slightly modified the way unique extras affect the fuel count. However now 15 unique extras asks about 3x as much fuel. Fun fact, as you increase volume at unique extras = 15, the percent increase between the new and old formulas approaches 327% :D
  In refueling, removed useless locals
  In refueling, accounted for the fact that turtle must come from the far edge of layer
  
----MenuAPI----
--Version 1.0.1
  Program will pass current index to handler
  New Function: separateLines will take text and split it into a table of lines (really just moved this from local)
