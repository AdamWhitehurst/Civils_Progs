====CHANGELOG====
 
----Quarry----
--Version 3.5.3 (first recorded)
  In saveProgress, fixed that extras would not be followed by a newLine
  In refuel, turtle now will go back start of inventory if item isn't fuel. Not pretty, but it will work OK
  In refueling section, turtle will check if its fuel requirement goes over the turtle fuel limit
  In refueling, slightly modified the way unique extras affect the fuel count. However now 15 unique extras asks about 3x as much fuel. Fun fact, as you increase volume at unique extras = 15, the percent increase between the new and old formulas approaches 327% :D
  In refueling, removed useless locals
  In refueling, accounted for the fact that turtle must come from the far edge of layer
  In mid-run refueling, turtle will not fuel itself over the fuel limit.
  In main mine function, added a check to see if turtle can get back to base with the fuel that it has. If it can barely do so, it will try to emergency refuel, or else return to base and error
  If turtle runs low on fuel, comes back and errors.
  Fixed turtle asking rednet enabled when there is no modem
  Removed invCheckFreq parameter. I doubt anyone used it. It now just checks every 1
  
--Version 3.5.4
  Updated rednet sending for new protocol
  Phased out turtle.getFuelLevel in favor of checkFuel
  
--Version 3.5.5
  Added new ore quarry to main program
  Removed inverting doDigUp and doDigDown in mine function
  digUp and digDown are now relative everywhere
  Now autoresumes by default!
  Fixed bug where turtle would loudly error when done
  Fixed bug where turtle does not immediately select 1 after fueling
  New parameters:
    -blacklist: set the name of the oreQuarry blacklist file
    -oldOreQuarry: forces use of old ore quarry, instead of new
    -autoResume: saves a startup file to run quarry with resume
    -autoRestart: same as above
    -startupRename: changes what the startup file is renamed to
    -startupName: the file to save the startup to (usually "startup" but I don't know what OSs may do)
    -promptAll: feeling adventurous? This will prompt you for literally every parameter
    
--Version 3.5.6
  Added in command aliases, like "kill" and "quit" for "stop" and "unpause" and "pause" for "resume"
  Fixed bug where turtle would error with auto-restart if rename file already exists
  Accounts for left quarry in GPS location (untested)
  Modified dig, up, down, and detect functions
  Improved startup file, if quarry save doesn't exist, will delete self as well. This is just an added safeguard.
  Added torch to default blacklist
  Added in a new option: inventoryMax. Not assignable by parameters, but if anyone still uses 1.2.5, this might work (a little late, but still, why not?)
  Added "specialSlots" table to easily check if a slot should not be dropped. Still need to implement it
  max fuel turtle can hold now respects doCheckFuel
  Cool Ideas from elektronemulo
  New Parameters:
    -flatBedrock [t/f]: The turtle will initially dig down to bedrock (or possibly a mob) and set startDown from that
    -left [t/f]: The turtle will quarry to the left instead of the right
    -maxFuel [number]: The number the turtle will stop fueling at. Basically just sets checkFuelLimit to this number
    -fuelChest [nothing or slot number]: Prompts for a chest with fuel it. This will be used if the turtle runs out of fuel. Recommended with maxfuel and doCheckFuel false

  Command sending is now per-screen, not global. Prevents issues where messages send in wrong order
