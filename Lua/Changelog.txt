====CHANGELOG====
 
----Quarry----
--Version 3.5.3 (first recorded)
  In saveProgress, fixed that extras would not be followed by a newLine
  In refuel, turtle now will go back start of inventory if item isn't fuel. Not pretty, but it will work OK
  In refueling section, turtle will check if its fuel requirement goes over the turtle fuel limit
  In refueling, slightly modified the way unique extras affect the fuel count. However now 15 unique extras asks about 3x as much fuel. Fun fact, as you increase volume at unique extras = 15, the percent increase between the new and old formulas approaches 327% :D
  In refueling, removed useless locals
  In refueling, accounted for the fact that turtle must come from the far edge of layer
  In mid-run refueling, turtle will not fuel itself over the fuel limit.
  In main mine function, added a check to see if turtle can get back to base with the fuel that it has. If it can barely do so, it will try to emergency refuel, or else return to base and error
  If turtle runs low on fuel, comes back and errors.
  Fixed turtle asking rednet enabled when there is no modem
  Removed invCheckFreq parameter. I doubt anyone used it. It now just checks every 1
--Version 3.5.4
  Updated rednet sending for new protocol
  Phased out turtle.getFuelLevel in favor of checkFuel
